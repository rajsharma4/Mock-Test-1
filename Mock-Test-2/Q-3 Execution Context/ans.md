3. Explain what is execution context in detail with diagram.


In JavaScript, the execution context is an abstract concept that describes the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It consists of a set of variables, functions, and objects that are available at a particular point during the execution of the code. The execution context plays a crucial role in determining how the code is executed and how variables and functions are accessed.

To understand the execution context, let's break it down into its components and explain each one in detail:

Global Execution Context:
The global execution context is the default context in JavaScript and represents the outermost scope. It is created when the JavaScript engine starts running the code and remains active throughout the entire runtime. In the global execution context, two important things are created: the global object (window object in the browser environment) and the 'this' keyword that refers to the global object.

Function Execution Context:
Whenever a function is invoked, a new execution context is created, known as the function execution context. Each function call has its own execution context, which includes the function's arguments, local variables, and references to the outer environment (lexical environment). The function execution context is pushed onto the call stack, and once the function completes its execution, the context is popped off the stack.

Lexical Environment:
The lexical environment is a key component of the execution context. It consists of two main parts: the environment record and the outer environment reference. The environment record is where the variable and function declarations are stored. It maintains a reference to all the variables and functions defined within the current scope. The outer environment reference points to the parent scope, enabling access to variables and functions defined in the outer scope.

Variable Environment:
The variable environment is a subset of the lexical environment. It is responsible for managing variables and their values within a particular execution context. Whenever a variable is declared, it is stored in the variable environment along with its initial value. During execution, variables are accessed and modified through the variable environment.

Now, let's visualize the relationship between these components with a diagram:
